    <h1>The Gallery</h1>
    <p person="Jones"> The body was found in the garden by the gardener, according to the villa owner they had rented it
      for an art gallery yesterday.</p>
    <p person="You"> Hmmm, interesting. Place must have been crowded, which means lots of witnesses,
      right?</p>
    <p person="Jones"> Indeed, but I'm afraid none of them had anything useful to say about the matter. You think the
      murder is related to all this art?</p>
    <p person="You"> It's definitely a possibility. We should check for anything out of the ordinary.</p>
